# Work Log

## README creation
- Added new README files under `packages/util/*` describing each utility package.
- Packages covered: `math`, `time-and`, `color`, `graph`, `html`, and `stdlib`.

## Update log
- Wrote summary of these changes in `docs/update_log.md`.

## Testing
- Ran `yarn install` to fetch dependencies.
- Executed `yarn test`; two test suites failed in unrelated packages (`tonal-pitch-space` and `util/color`).
