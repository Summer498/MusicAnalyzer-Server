# Package Template

This folder serves as a starting point when creating new packages for the MusicAnalyzer project. It provides a minimal setup with `index.ts`, `package.json`, and TypeScript configuration files.

## Usage
Copy this directory when adding a new package and update the names and metadata as needed. The template includes only a placeholder implementation so that each new package starts from a clean slate.

## Planned Improvements
Future versions of this template may include example test files, lint settings, and build scripts to help contributors get started more quickly.
