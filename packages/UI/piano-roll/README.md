# Piano Roll Views

This directory provides components used to render a piano roll interface.

- **beat-view** draws beat bars so that playback timing can be followed.
- **chord-view** shows chord names and brackets above the roll.
- **melody-view** paints melody notes at multiple hierarchy levels.
- **piano-roll** combines the above elements and manages background graphics.

Each submodule exposes small view classes that can be assembled into the application UI.
