# Post Crepe CLI

Processes frequency estimation results generated by [Crepe](https://github.com/marl/crepe).

## index.ts

- **main(argv: string[])**
  - Reads a CSV exported by Crepe, parses it into `VocalsF0CSV` objects and generates several filtered frequency arrays.
  - Uses helper functions from `post-f0-util` and `src/` to smooth and band‑limit the frequencies.
  - Delegates output creation to `postProcess`.
- **postProcess(dir, SAMPLING_RATE, bandpass, frequency)**
  - Writes band-pass filtered data, MIDI converted notes and sine wave audio files to the specified directory.

## src/

- **getMedianFrequency(freq_rounded: number[])**
  - Applies a median filter to remove spike noise using `MedianFilter`.
- **MedianFilter class**
  - Implements a sliding window median using a ring buffer (`median-filter.ts`).
- **VocalsF0CSV type**
  - Represents Crepe CSV rows with `time`, `frequency` and `confidence` fields.

This CLI is useful for post‑processing F0 sequences and producing files for further analysis.
